Next.js, a popular web development framework, offers two pre-rendering options: **Static Generation** and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**. Each method differs in when HTML is generated for a page. Next.js allows you to choose the pre-rendering approach on a per-page basis, enabling the creation of hybrid apps that combine Static Generation and SSR.

**Static Generation (SG):**
- HTML is generated at build time and reused for each request.
- Ideal for static content and provides faster page loads.
- Compatible with CDNs and offers SEO benefits.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
- HTML is generated dynamically on each request.
- Suitable for real-time data updates and pages with frequently changing content.
- Supports complex client-server interactions.

**Creating a Hybrid Next.js App:**
- Next.js allows combining Static Generation and SSR.
- Use Static Generation for most pages and SSR for specific pages with dynamic content.
- Provides performance optimization and dynamic functionality.

Next.js provides Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering options. _Static Generation offers faster loading times and scalability_, while _SSR allows for real-time updates and dynamic content_. By leveraging a hybrid approach and choosing the appropriate pre-rendering method for each page, developers can achieve optimized performance and deliver a tailored user experience.
