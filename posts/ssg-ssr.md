When building web pages, deciding **between Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is essential. Static Generation involves pre-rendering pages, while SSR renders pages dynamically. Let's explore the benefits and considerations of each approach to help you make an informed decision.

**Static Generation:**
- Pre-render pages for fast CDN delivery.
- Ideal for non-real-time data, such as marketing pages, blog posts, e-commerce listings, and documentation.
- Offers faster page loading, improved scalability, SEO friendliness, and enhanced security.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
- Renders pages on each user request.
- Suitable for real-time data updates and complex interactions.
- Ensures up-to-date content but can be slower than Static Generation.

**Considerations:**
- Use Static Generation when pre-rendering is possible.
- SSR is ideal for pages with frequently updated data or dynamic content.
- Alternatively, consider client-side rendering or a hybrid approach for specific scenarios.

Selecting the right page generation approach is crucial. _Static Generation offers speed and scalability_, while _SSR ensures real-time updates_. Assess your content requirements to determine which method best suits your needs, or explore alternative strategies like client-side rendering or a hybrid approach.
